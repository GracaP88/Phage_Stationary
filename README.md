Highlights
	SEP1 efficiently infects both exponential and stationary cells of S. epidermidis.
	In stationary cells, SEP1 transcription is more delayed than in exponential cells.
	S. epidermidis responded to SEP1 infection by upregulating genes from a DNA modification system.
	SEP1 activates the metabolism of stationary cells to be able to replicate.
